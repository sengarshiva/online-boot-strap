                    and leaders in the industry. Starting with their first brand, Lazeez Affaire, Priyank popularised
                    the conceptof fine dining at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its success, First
                    Fiddle introduced the concept of casual dining with brands such as Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of
                    The Drinks, Flying Saucer Cafe, and more, storming Delhi’s nightlife. WIth each new brand, First
                    Fiddle brought a concept that was never experienced or heard of before, such as Plum by Bent Chair,
                    Miso Sexy, Diablo, and more. The restaurants are spread all over India in major metropolitan cities
                    like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and more, with plans to expand internationally soon</p>
